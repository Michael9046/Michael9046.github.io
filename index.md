## Self Assessment

<p>
  The project presented in this portfolio demonstrates my ability to solve complex problems and implement
additional features within an existing application. Taking an existing project and enhancing it through critical thinkingand using outside resources like Android's development page. 
My work on these enhancements drew from early coding lessons from
my Computer Science program, including basic Java syntax, database management and querying, and working
with Android Studio. While I did not address all security concerns within the application, I documented them to show my ability to think with a security mindset.
</p>

<p>
For this project, I chose to enhance a previous Android Mobile Application I created in my CS 360 class in 2024.
This application is an Event Tracking Application. 
It originally only featured:
  - a sign-in page for returning users 
  - a registration option for new users.
  - Signed in users could only create events by navigating a calendar view and filling out an event form         with all relevant details.

  These events are saved to a SQLite database using local storage and are viewable when selecting
  the date they were scheduled.

Below are links to my initial code review video before enhancements and the enhancements themselves.
These are meant to showcase my growth in the Computer Science program with accompanied narratives.
