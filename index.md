    <h2> **Self Assesment** </h2>
<p>    The project presented in this portofolio demonstrates my ability to solve complex problems and implement
    additional features within an exisiting application.  Taking an exisiting project and enhancing it through critical thinking
    and using outside resources that are available to me line Android's development page.  My work on these enhancements drew from early coding lessons from
    my Computer Science program.  This included things like basic java syntax, database management and querying, and working
    with Android Studio.  While I did not address all security concerns within the application I did make note of them showing
    my ability to think about my work from a security mindset.  

        For this project I chose to enhance a previous Android Mobile Application I created in my CS 360 Class in 2024.
    This Application is an Event Tracking Application.  It features a sign in page for returning users 
    as well as a registering option for new ones.  After signing in it allows users to create Events 
    by navigating a Calendar View and filling out an Event form for all relevant details.
    The events are saved to a SQLite database using local storage and are viewable.        
    
Below are my enhancements to this project as well as any narratives, and my initial code review video before enhancements.</p>
