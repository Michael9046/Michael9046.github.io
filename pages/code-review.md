## Introduction
  This code review was a brief review of the code for my application before any enhancements began.
I had already chosen what enhancements I was planning on doing already and was attempting to refamiliarize   myself with my original work from the previous year while introducing you to the project.  

  I've also included some images of the Login Screen and the Main Activity screen where users interact with the calendar.

Upon start up the users are prompted to log in or register.  Once checked or added to the database they are greeted by the Calendar View which serves as the main view of the application.
