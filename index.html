<h1>Michael Hymel — CS 499 ePortfolio</h1>
<p>For this Capstone I chose to enhance a previous Android Mobile Application I created in my CS 360 Class in 2024.
    This Application is an Event Tracking Application.  It features a sign in page for returning users 
    as well as a registering option for new ones.  After signing in it allows users to create Events 
    by navigating a Calendar View and filling out an Event form for all relevant details.
    The events are saved to a SQLite database using local storage and are viewable.
    
Below are my enhancements to this project as well as any narratives, and my initial code review video before enhancements.</p>
