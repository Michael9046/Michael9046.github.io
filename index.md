# Michael Hymel — CS 499 Capstone ePortfolio

## Self Assessment

<p>
The project presented in this portfolio demonstrates my ability to solve complex problems and implement
additional features within an existing application. Taking an existing project and enhancing it through critical thinking
and using outside resources like Android's development page. My work on these enhancements drew from early coding lessons from
my Computer Science program, including basic Java syntax, database management and querying, and working
with Android Studio. While I did not address all security concerns within the application, I documented them to show
my ability to think with a security mindset.

<p>
For this project, I chose to enhance a previous Android Mobile Application I created in my CS 360 class in 2024.
This application is an Event Tracking Application. It features a sign-in page for returning users 
as well as a registration option for new ones. After signing in, users can create events 
by navigating a calendar view and filling out an event form with all relevant details.
These events are saved to a SQLite database using local storage and are viewable.
