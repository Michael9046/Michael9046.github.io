## Self Assessment

<p>
  The project presented in this portfolio demonstrates my ability to solve complex problems and implement
additional features within an existing application. By taking an existing project of mine and enhancing it through critical thinking and using outside resources like Android's development page and community resources.  Each enhancement is showcasing my abilities in Software design and engineering, working with algorithms and data structures, and managing databases.
</p>

<p>
I chose to enhance a previous Android Mobile Application I created in my CS 360 class in 2024.
This application is an Event Tracking Application.
</p>

  Once I completed the course the application only featured:
  - a sign-in page for returning users. 
  - a registration option for new users.
  - a database to store users and their events.
  - an interactive calendar and floating action button to add events.
  - simple UI design.
<p>
  These events are saved to a SQLite database using local storage and were only viewable when selecting
  the date they were scheduled.
</p>

<p>
  My work on the following enhancements drew from early coding and database courses from
my Computer Science program, including basic Java syntax, database management and querying, and working
with Android Studio. While I did not address all security concerns within the application, I documented them to show my ability to think with a security mindset.  
</p>

Below are links to my initial code review video before enhancements and brief narratives of each enhancement.

A link to the original and enhanced Source Code is also available.
